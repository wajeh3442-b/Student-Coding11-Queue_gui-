Queue Implementation in Java
Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a queue, a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed. Queues are widely used in scheduling tasks, managing requests, and buffering data streams.

Features

Enqueue elements at the rear of the queue.

Dequeue elements from the front of the queue.

Peek to view the front element.

Display all elements in the queue.

Handles underflow and overflow conditions gracefully.

How to Use

Compile and run the Java program.

Choose operations from the menu: enqueue, dequeue, peek, display.

Enter integer values as prompted.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

No external libraries needed.

Notes

Queue operations can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

The program demonstrates dynamic behavior and proper error handling for empty or full queues.
